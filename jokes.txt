Q: What's the best part about boolean logic?
A: Even when you're wrong, you're only a bit off!

A woman goes to the doctor for a check-up and the doctor says she only has 3 months to live. She asks the doctor for a second opinion and he has a dog come in and sniff her. He says she still only has 3 months to live. She asks for another opinion and the doctor has a cat come in and sniff her this time. He says she has only 3 months to live and that it will be $550. She thought it was only $50. The doctor says that was before the Lab report and the Cat scan.
